## Fibonanci Sequence Kata


The function takes number of steps and returns the sequence
 - Returns [0] for 0
 - Returns [0,1] for 1
 - Returns [0,1,1] for 2
 - Returns [0,1,1,2] for 3
 - Returns [0,1,1,2,3] for 4
 
 
Try to develop the algorithm iteratively by writing just enough code to pass each step.

Once you have enough passing tests refactor the code to use recursion.

In cases where intuition is required to use recursion or a well known algorithm, TDD does not necessarily lead to best or most efficient design though it does ensure complete coverage of all the cases.
